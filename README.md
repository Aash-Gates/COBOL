What Is COBOL?
COBOL is a high-level programming language like C, C#, Java, Pascal, or BASIC, but it is one with a particular focus
and a long history.

COBOL’s Target Application Domain

The name COBOL is an acronym that stands for Common Business Oriented Language, and this expanded acronym
clearly indicates the target domain of the language. Whereas most other high-level programming languages are
general-purpose, domain-independent languages, COBOL is focused on business, or enterprise, computing. You
would not use COBOL to write a computer game or a compiler or an operating system. With no low-level access, no
dynamic memory allocation, and no recursion, COBOL does not have the constructs that facilitate the creation of
these kinds of program. This is one of the reasons most universities do not teach COBOL. Because it cannot be used
to create data structures such as linked lists, queues, or stacks or to develop algorithms like Quicksort, some other
programming language has to be taught to allow instruction in these computer science concepts. The curriculum is so
crowded nowadays that there is often no room to introduce two programming languages, especially when one of them
seems to offer little educational benefit.
Although COBOL’s design may preclude it from being used as a general-purpose programming language, it is
well suited for developing long-lived, data-oriented business applications. COBOL’s forte is the processing of data
transactions, especially those involving money, and this focus puts it at the heart of the mission-critical systems
that run the world. COBOL is found in insurance systems, banking systems, finance systems, stock dealing systems,
government systems, military systems, telephony systems, hospital systems, airline systems, traffic systems, and
many, many others. It may be only a slight exaggeration to say that the world runs on COBOL.
